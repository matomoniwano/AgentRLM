Given this Jupyter notebook that failed to execute and the error trace below, propose minimal corrections to fix the failing cell(s).

**Failing Cell Code:**
```python
{failing_cell_code}
```

**Error Trace:**
```
{error_trace}
```

**Surrounding Context:**
Previous cells:
{previous_cells}

Following cells (if any):
{following_cells}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the error and provide corrected cells. Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:

{{
  "analysis": "Brief explanation of what went wrong",
  "cells": [
    {{
      "cell_type": "code",
      "source": "# Corrected code here",
      "cell_index": 3
    }}
  ]
}}

Guidelines:
- Only include cells that need to be changed (specify their cell_index)
- Provide the complete corrected source for each cell
- Common fixes: missing imports, incorrect variable names, API changes, syntax errors
- If a package is missing, add it to an earlier install cell
- Keep changes minimal - only fix what's broken
- Maintain the same functionality and intent

Remember: Output ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
